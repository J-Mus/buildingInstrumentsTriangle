# Collaborating Instructions

I will focus instructions on using GitHub desktop as its a little easier. If you have Git installed already and want to use command line please feel free. If you have get installed already and want to use command line please feel free.

Before we get started, If you don't have one, create a github account at github.com

And download and Install GitHub desktop https://desktop.github.com

## concept

Collaboarative software development uses the concept of contributors creating branches of a repository each with a specific change in the code, this could be a new feature or bug fix.

When a contributor finishes the addition or fix they submit a "pull request" this sends the contribution to the project leader with a list of changes. The pull request is the application to merge the contribution branch into the main branch of the software.

## steps

1. Fork the project in github, you don't have write access to the main repository so this creates a copy which you can write to.
2. Clone the fork to your computer. This downloads a copy of the remote repository onto your computer, also known as the local repository 
3. Create a branch for your contribution - use a desriptive name
4. Regulally this creates a time stamp and desciption of your work in progress - it improves error finding
5. push, this copies the local repository on your computer to the github server for save keeping
6. pull request, this sends a request to merge your contribution branch to the original repository.

This project uses two main braches
 
- Development - this is the new version we are working on
- Master - this is the working software

Please submit all pull requests to the development branch.

Happy coding,
Josh
